# Data-Driven ChatGPT Insight Tool

## Description
This Python application is designed to analyze and visualize survey data collected from 100 students regarding their usage and opinions of ChatGPT. 
The survey was conducted using a Google Form. This script employs the matplotlib library to generate insightful graphs and pandas for handling the survey data, 
which is stored in a CSV file.

## Features
- **Data Importing:** Utilizes pandas to read and process data from a CSV file (surveydata.csv).
- **Graphical Visualization:** Creates various charts and graphs to represent the survey data, enhancing the comprehensibility of the survey results.
- **Customized Graphs:** Each function within the script corresponds to a specific question from the survey and visualizes the responses to that question.

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the pandas and matplotlib libraries.
2. Download the PythonGraphs.py and surveydata.csv files to your local machine.
3. Place both files in the same directory.
4. Open your command line interface (CLI).
5. Navigate to the directory where the files are located.
6. Run the command: python PythonGraphs.py.
7. View the generated graphs, which will display the analysis of the survey data.
