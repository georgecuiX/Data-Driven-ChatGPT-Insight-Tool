# Data-Driven ChatGPT Insight Tool

## Description
This Python application is designed to analyze and visualize survey data collected from 100 students regarding their usage and opinions of ChatGPT. 
The survey was conducted using a Google Form. This script employs the matplotlib library to generate insightful graphs and pandas for handling the survey data, 
which is stored in a CSV file.

## Features
- **Data Importing:** Utilizes pandas to read and process data from a CSV file (surveydata.csv).
- **Graphical Visualization:** Creates various charts and graphs to represent the survey data, enhancing the comprehensibility of the survey results.
- **Customized Graphs:** Each function within the script corresponds to a specific question from the survey and visualizes the responses to that question.
- **User-Friendly:** Simplifies the process of data analysis for those with minimal programming background.
